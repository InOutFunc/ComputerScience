## triggers

```mysql
delimiter $$

create trigger payments_after_insert
	after insert on payments
	for each row
begin
	update invoices
	set payment_total = payment_total + new.amount
	where invoice_id = new.invoice_id;
end $$
delimiter ;

insert into payments
values (default, 5, 3, '2019-01-01', 10, 1)

delimiter $$
create trigger payments_after_delete
	after delete on payments
	for each row
begin
	update invoices
	set payment_total = payment_total - old.amount
	where 
```

## dropping triggers

```mysql
drop trigger if exists payments_after_insert
```

## sing triggers for auditing

```cpp
insert into payments_audit
values(new.client_id, new.date, new.amount, 'insert', now());

insert into payments_audit
```

## events

```mysql
show variables like 'event%';
set global event_scheduler = on

delimiter $$

create event yearly_delete_state_audit_rows
on schedule
	-- at '2019-05-01'
	every 1 year starts '2019-01-01' ends '2029-01-01'
do begin
	delete from payments_audit
	where action_date < now() - interval 1 year;
end $$

delimiter ;
```

## viewing, dropping and altering events

```mysql
show events like 'yearly%';
drop event if exists yearly;
alter event yearly disable;
alter event yearly enable;
```

## transactions

```mysql
atomicity
consistency
isolation
durability
```

## 86creating transactions

```mysql
start transaction;
insert into orders (customer_id, order_date, status)
values (1, '2019-01-01', 1);

insert into order_items
values (LAST_INSERT_ID(), 1, 1, 1);

commit;
-- rollback;

show variables like 'autocommit'
```

## 87 concurrency and locking

```mysql
start transaction;
update customers
set points = points + 10
where customer_id = 1;
commit;

start transaction;
update customers
set points = points + 10
where customer_id = 1;
commit;
```

## 88 concurrency problems

```mysql
lost updates
dirty reads
non-repeating
phantom reads
```

## 89 transaction isolation

```mysql
read uncommitted
read committed
repeatable read
serializable

show variables like 'transaction_isolation'
set transaction isolation level serializable;
set session transaction isolation level serializable;
set global transaction isolation level serializable;
```

## 90 read uncommitted isolation level

```mysql
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted;
select points
from customers
where customer_id = 1;

start transaction;
update customers
set points = 20
where customer_id = 1;;
commit;
```

## 91 read committed isolation level

```mysql
set transaction isolation level read committed;
select points
from customers
where customer_id = 1;

start transaction;
update customers
set points = 20
where customer_id = 1;;
commit;
```

## p92 repeatable read isolation level

```mysql
set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
start transaction;
select points from customers where customer_id = 1;
select points from customers where customer_id = 1;
commit;

start transaction;
update customers
set points = 40
where customer_id = 1;
commit;

set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
start transaction;
select * from customers where state = 'va';
commit;

start transaction;
update customers
set state = 'va'
where customer_id = 1;
commit;
```

## p93 serializable isolation level

```mysql
set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
start transaction;
select * from customers where state = 'va';
commit

start transaction;
update customers
set state = 'va'
where customer_id = 3;
commit;
```

## 94 deadlocks

```mysql
start transaction;
update customers set state = 'va' where customer_id = 1;
update orders set status = 1 where order_id = 1;
commit;

start transaction;
update orders set status = 1 where order_id = 1;
update customers set state = 'va' where order_id = 1;
commit;
```
